# Antisimplistic Blog

> A personal technical blog covering AI-assisted development, developer tools, and the craft of teaching with code. Posts are primarily TILs (Today I Learned) - small, specific discoveries from actual work sessions - plus longer pieces on development philosophy and workflows.
