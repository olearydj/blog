## The Problem

I needed an `ADMIN_TOKEN` available in my terminal for production monitoring
commands. I didn't want to:

- Export it inline before each command (clumsy, exposes secrets in LLM chat
histories)
- Write wrapper scripts/aliases that set it (adds complexity)
- Set it globally in `~/.zshrc` (always loaded, pollutes environment)
- Store it in `.env` (doesn't load for terminal commands)

I wanted project-specific secrets that auto-load when I enter the directory
and disappear when I leave. That's [direnv](https://direnv.net/).

## What is direnv?

`direnv` auto-loads and unloads environment variables based on your current
directory. It's the standard solution for project-specific configuration like
API keys and tokens.

### Setup

```bash
# macOS
brew install direnv
# Add to ~/.zshrc (one-time)
echo 'eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### My Workflow

1. Create .envrc in project root:

```bash
cd my-project
echo 'export ADMIN_TOKEN="my_super_secure_token"' > .envrc
```

2. Allow direnv to load it:

```bash
direnv allow
```

3. Use the variable:

```bash
curl -H "X-Admin-Token: $ADMIN_TOKEN" https://api.example.com
./scripts/preflight_check.sh  # ADMIN_TOKEN automatically available
```

4. Leave directory - variable disappears:

```bash
cd ~
echo $ADMIN_TOKEN  # (empty)
```

`direnv` won't auto-run untrusted `.envrc` files - you must explicitly direnv
allow each one after reviewing its contents.

> [!WARNING]
> Always add `.envrc` and `.env` to `.gitignore` - **never commit secrets**.

### Common Use Cases

```bash
# .envrc
# API keys and tokens
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-definitely_not_my_real_key"
# Database credentials
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://admin:my_super_secure_password@localhost/mydb"
# App configuration
export FLASK_ENV="development"
```
