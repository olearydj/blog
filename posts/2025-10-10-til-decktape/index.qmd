## The Problem

I've been using Quarto with Reveal.js for presentations, and while they look great in the browser, getting them into PDF format has always been... frustrating. Browser print-to-PDF works, but the formatting is often wonky. Quarto's built-in PDF export is fine but loses some of the reveal.js magic.

## The Solution: Decktape

Enter [Decktape](https://github.com/astefanutti/decktape) - a headless Chrome tool specifically designed to convert HTML presentations to PDF. And it's brilliant.

### Install

```bash
npm install -g decktape
```

### Use

```bash
# Start your presentation
quarto preview presentation.qmd

# In another terminal, convert to PDF
decktape http://localhost:XXXX/presentation.html output.pdf
```

That's it. Decktape renders each slide exactly as it appears in the browser, then combines them into a crisp PDF.

## Why It's Better

- High fidelity: Slides look exactly like they do in the browser
- Handles animations: Captures fragments and builds correctly
- Works with Mermaid: Diagrams render perfectly
- Custom styling preserved: All your CSS comes through
- Professional output: No weird page breaks or formatting issues

Where has this been all my life?!

## Bonus: Options

```bash
# Custom page size
decktape --size 1920x1080 http://localhost:XXXX/presentation.html output.pdf

# Pause between slides (for heavy animations)
decktape --pause 1000 http://localhost:XXXX/presentation.html output.pdf

# Specify slide range
decktape --slides 1-10 http://localhost:XXXX/presentation.html output.pdf
```
