## The Problem

When Claude Code needs Python for ad-hoc tasks (e.g., parsing Excel files, reading PDFs, quick data analysis) it uses whatever Python is available. This can cause issues:

- No isolation: packages installed to user site-packages
- Version uncertainty: using whatever Python happened to be installed
- Dependency conflicts: risk of polluting project-specific environments
- Ambiguity: no clear boundary between ad-hoc work and project venvs

I wanted a dedicated, managed environment for Claude Code's throwaway tasks that wouldn't interfere with anything else.

## The Solution

A uv-managed Python environment specifically for Claude Code's ad-hoc work, invoked via a distinct shell command.

### Why uv?

```bash
brew install uv
```

- Fast: installs packages in seconds, not minutes
- Modern: handles both package management and environment isolation
- Simple: one tool instead of virtualenv + pip + pyenv
- Flex: all the cool kids use it 😎

### Project Setup

Create a dedicated project directory:

```bash
mkdir -p /casa/dev/claude-code
cd /casa/dev/claude-code
uv init
```

The `pyproject.toml` declares whatever dependencies your agent might need:

```toml
[project]
name = "claude-adhoc"
version = "0.1.0"
requires-python = ">=3.11"
dependencies = [
    # Data/Files
    "pandas",
    "numpy",
    "openpyxl",
    "xlrd",
    "python-pptx",
    "python-docx",
    "pypdf",
    "pdfplumber",
    "pillow",
    "pyyaml",
    # Web
    "requests",
    "httpx",
    "beautifulsoup4",
    "lxml",
    # Utilities
    "rich",
    "chardet",
    "matplotlib",
    "seaborn",
    # Dev tools
    "ruff",
    "mypy",
    "pytest",
]
```

Add these with `uv add <package>` or just ask your robot to do it. 🤖

### Shell Script

Create an executable script (not a shell function) and add it to your PATH:

```bash
#!/bin/zsh
echo "⚠️  This Python instance is for ad-hoc usage only."
echo "   If working in a project with its own venv, use that instead."
echo ""
exec uv run --project /casa/dev/claude-code python "$@"
```

Save this as `~/.config/scripts/claude-adhoc-python` (or wherever you keep scripts), make it executable, and symlink it to a directory in your PATH:

```bash
chmod +x ~/.config/scripts/claude-adhoc-python
ln -sf ~/.config/scripts/claude-adhoc-python ~/.local/bin/claude-adhoc-python
```

Why a script instead of a shell function? Claude Code's Bash tool runs in a non-interactive shell, which only sources `.zshenv` - not `.zshrc` or any files it sources. Shell functions defined in `.zshrc` won't be available. A standalone script in your PATH works everywhere.

Key design choices:

| Choice | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| Standalone script | Works in non-interactive shells (like Claude Code's Bash) |
| Distinct command name | Avoids confusion with project-local Python |
| Warning message | Reminds both Claude and user this is for ad-hoc use |

### Claude Code Instructions

Add to your global `~/.config/claude/CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
## Ad-hoc Python

For quick Python tasks outside of project contexts, use:

    claude-adhoc-python -c "import pandas as pd; ..."

DO NOT use this inside projects that have their own venv or pyproject.toml.
Use the project's environment instead.
```

This tells Claude when to use the ad-hoc environment and - critically - when not to.

## Usage

One-liners:

```bash
claude-adhoc-python -c "import pandas as pd; print(pd.read_excel('data.xlsx').head())"
```

Scripts:

```bash
claude-adhoc-python script.py
```

Or invoke uv directly:

```bash
uv run --project /casa/dev/claude-code python -c "import pdfplumber; ..."
```

## If You Use the Sandbox

Everything above works great until you enable [Claude Code's sandbox](/posts/2026-02-02-claude-code-permissions/). The sandbox blocks `.git` access broadly - not just repositories, but `.git` marker files anywhere on the filesystem. The uv cache uses these markers to prevent git from indexing it, so `uv run` panics with "Operation not permitted" and takes the wrapper script down with it.

The workaround: update your `CLAUDE.md` to point Claude at the venv Python directly:

```bash
/path/to/adhoc/.venv/bin/python script.py
```

This bypasses `uv run` entirely. Packages are still managed with `uv add` - you just skip the runtime wrapper. The warning message from the shell script is lost, but the `CLAUDE.md` instructions carry the same signal.

## What I Didn't Do

No `ipykernel`: Claude Code's Bash tool is stateless; each command runs in a fresh shell. A persistent REPL adds no value here.

No activation script: the `uv run --project` pattern handles isolation without needing to "activate" anything. Simpler mental model.

## Maintenance

Add packages as needed:

```bash
cd /casa/dev/claude-code
uv add some-new-package
```

Update everything:

```bash
uv sync --upgrade
```
