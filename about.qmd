I'm Dan O'Leary - a data science instructor, recovering engineer, and relentless tinkerer. I teach people to work with data and code, and I spend an unreasonable amount of time configuring my tools.

This blog documents what I learn along the way. Most posts are TILs - small, specific discoveries from actual work sessions. Some are longer pieces about how I think about development, AI tooling, and the craft of teaching technical subjects.

The name *Terminally Curious* is both a confession and a job description.
