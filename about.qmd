I'm Dan O'Leary - a recovering entrepreneur, second-career academic, and relentless tinkerer. After 22 years building games, I now teach product development, data science, and machine learning at Auburn University.

This blog documents what I learn along the way. Many posts are TILs — small, specific discoveries from actual work sessions. Some are longer pieces about how I think about development, AI tooling, and the craft of teaching technical subjects.

The name *Terminally Curious* is both a confession and a job description.
